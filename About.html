        of a way to start a business or a new product to develop? TechConnect can bring determined students together with 
        available technology to further innovation and produce revenue for the university, faculty, and students.

        community where IP, disclosures, and patents can be shared wtih entrepreneurs and funding sources to provide rapid technological
        development.
