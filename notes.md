Today I completed the following deilverables:
1) I created a HTML page for each page of my applicataion including some CSS stlying, and a custom logo. I also learned small details sucha s how to center an image 
2) I created the place holders for the Database which will collect usernames and passwords. I am still unsure how to fully link the data base to my website 
3) I created the place holder for the websocket. In my home page, I envision the websocket allowing messaging within the application of user comments and I added the initail framework of the communication. I am still unsure on how to complete it.
